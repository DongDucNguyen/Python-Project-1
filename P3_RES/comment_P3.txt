1. Number of Groups (K):
   - Based on the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score analysis, K=6 clusters were chosen.
   - The Elbow plot likely showed diminishing returns in WCSS reduction around K=6.
   - The Silhouette Score plot might have indicated a peak or high value at K=6, suggesting reasonable cluster separation.
   - This aligns with the common understanding of distinct player roles in football (e.g., Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, Forwards).

2. PCA and Clustering Plot:
   - PCA was used to reduce the 74 features to 2 dimensions for visualization.
   - The 2D scatter plot shows the distribution of players based on these two principal components, colored by their assigned K-means cluster.
   - Interpretation of the plot:
     - Observe the separation between clusters. Are they distinct or overlapping?
     - Do the clusters seem to correspond to player positions? (We could verify this by looking at the `Position` column for players within each cluster). For instance, one cluster might predominantly contain Goalkeepers due to their unique stats, while others might represent defenders, midfielders, and attackers.
     - The spread and density of points within each cluster provide insight into the similarity of players grouped together based on the selected statistics.
